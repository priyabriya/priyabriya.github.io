## Role: Technical Product Manager (TPM) Strategy

### 1. The Mandate
**Target Career Outcome:** Secure a TPM or Technical Analyst role at a Tier-1 Tech Firm or Enterprise (e.g., Lockheed Martin, Google, Prudential) within the Tri-State area.
**Positioning:** Branding [Your Name] as "The Translator"—the essential link between complex engineering (Code) and organizational ROI (Business).

### 2. The Tech Stack
* **Framework:** **HTML5 / Tailwind CSS**
    * *Why:* To meet the "No complex code" requirement while ensuring a modern, "Big Tech" aesthetic. Tailwind allows for rapid styling without the bloat of heavy frameworks.
* **Deployment:** **GitHub Pages or Vercel**
    * *Why:* Fast, free, and demonstrates familiarity with industry-standard CI/CD pipelines.
* **Form Handling:** **Formspree or Netlify Forms**
    * *Why:* Simple "Lead-Gen" functionality without needing a dedicated backend/database.

### 3. The Sitemap (Single-Page Narrative)
* **Hero Section:** * *Visual:* High-quality professional headshot ("The Human Element").
    * *Copy:* "Bridging the Gap Between Code and Business Strategy."
* **Product Leadership (The "Business" Pillar):**
    * Metrics-heavy cards for **ACM VP** and **HackNJIT**. 
    * Key Stats: 350+ participants, 15+ Special Interest Groups.
* **Technical Case Studies (The "Code" Pillar):**
    * **Themis (AI Political Bias):** Focus on the "Problem" (media bias) and "Solution" (NLP/Flask).
    * **Coral Map:** Focus on data visualization and award-winning execution.
* **The Security Brief (The "Brief" Mention):**
    * A concise section on the **JCTF** event (300+ participants) to signal a "Security Mindset."
* **Lead-Gen / Contact:**
    * A clean, professional contact area focused on the Tri-State network.

### 4. Non-Negotiables
* **Mobile-Responsiveness:** Must be "Thumb-Friendly." Recruiters will likely view this from a LinkedIn mobile link.
* **SEO Optimization (NJ/NY):** * Keywords: *Information Systems NJIT, Technical Product Manager NYC, NJ Tech Leadership, HackNJIT Organizer.*
* **Tri-State Impact:** Explicit mention of contributions to the Newark/NYC tech ecosystem.
* **Specific CTA:** "Download Resume for TPM Roles" and a "Connect on LinkedIn" primary button.

### 5. Tone & Voice
* **Modern Professional:** Authoritative but approachable. Avoid jargon-heavy "dev-speak"; use "product-speak" (impact, scale, stakeholders, solutions).
